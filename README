TJRPC - Trivial JSON Remote Procedure Call

Copyright 2010,2011 Kunshan Wang

TJRPC is a JSON-based RPC tool.  It is a small toy project to be used where
you just need some simple RPC capability, but do not worry much about its
performance or functionality.

This program is implemented in Java.  It provides a TCP-based RPC server and
client implementation, as well as proxy support based on java reflection.

Note that the protocol is NOT the same as json-rpc.org

This program depends on JSON Tools for JSON parsing.

This program is released under the GNU LGPL licence.
